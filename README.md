# Weather app :umbrella::sunny::snowflake:
###  [Check out the live demo](https://fedelopez17.github.io/weather-app)! :smile:

## Description:
This project is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).<br>
It allows the user to look up the state of the weather on any city of their choosing by fetching data from the [OpenWeather current weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current).<br>
It served me as further practice with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and webpack. Plus, it also was my first project using Prettier and ESLint.

## Technologies used:

## New things learned:
- How viewport height units aren't completely reliable, especially in mobile phones, and a work-around for this.<br>
- How to use Prettier and ESLint to format and lint my code.<br>
- Got more familiar with both webpack and npm, although I'm still far from mastering them, especially webpack.<br>
- How useful browser extensions can be when developing a web application. For this project, I used the Responsive Viewer extension on Google Chrome.<br>
- Acquired a deeper understanding of APIs and asynchronous JavaScript.<br>
